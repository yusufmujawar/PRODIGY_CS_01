Task: Implement of Caesar Cipher Technique
Date: 02-December-2024


*** WELCOME TO CAESAR CIPHER ENCRYPTION & DECRYPTION TECHNIQUE ***

During my internship at Prodigy InfoTech, I was assigned my first task, which involved developing a Python program that implemented the Caesar Cipher algorithm for text encryption and decryption. This program allows users to input a message along with a specified shift value, enabling both encryption and decryption processes. This assignment not only empowers users to choose their preferred method but also offers an engaging opportunity to participate in a meaningful project. Although the task may be small in scope, it provided me with valuable insights into the mechanics of the algorithm.
