                                                        *** WELCOME TO CAESAR CIPHER ENCRYPTION & DECRYPTION TECHNIQUE ***
During my internship at Prodigy InfoTech, I was assigned the development of a Python program utilizing the Caesar Cipher algorithm for the purposes of text encryption and decryption. This program enables users to input a message alongside a designated shift value, thereby facilitating both the encryption and decryption processes. This assignment not only allows users to choose their preferred method but also presents an engaging opportunity to participate in a meaningful project. Although this task may be small in scope, it provided me with valuable insights into the mechanics of the algorithm.
